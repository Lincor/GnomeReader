Gnome (Unofficial) Reader - a feed reader for Gnome
===============================================================================

Gnome (Unofficial) Reader is a feed reader built for the Gnome desktop
environment.

Inspired by:
https://wiki.gnome.org/Design/Apps/Potential/News
https://github.com/gnome-design-team/gnome-prototypes/blob/master/feed/feeds.png

REQUIREMENTS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - gtk+-3.0 >= 3.11.6
  - tracker-sparql-0.16 >= 0.16.2
  - webkit2gtk-3.0 >= 2.2.6
  - libgrss-0.5 >= 0.5.0

Gnome (Unofficial) Reader uses Tracker as backend, and requires
tracker-miner-rss to be available. This way all the business logic about
fetching and updating feeds is delegated, here is implemented just the frontend
to browse contents.

TODO
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Reader
  - display number of unread items for channels
  - fuzzy dates in items list (at least "Today" and "Yesterday")
  - ability to import from OPML (via libgrss)
  - meta-channel including all unread items from all channels
  - handle enclosures (for podcasts?)
  - use the channel's home screen in smart way
  - ability to tag items

Involving tracker-miner-rss
  - properly update mfo:unreadCount
  - handle fetching and caching of embedded contents (e.g. images)

Involving libgrss
  - discover favicon of the channel (cfr. favicon.c in Liferea)
  - discover relevant image in item, to be used as cover
